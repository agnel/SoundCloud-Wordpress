SoundCloud Wordpress plugin.

Created at SF Music Hack day by Richard Caceres with help from the SoundCloud team.

See the screenshots to get an idea on how it functions. It should work if you
put the "SoundCloud-Wordpress" folder inside the Wordpress plugins folder.

I'm open to contributors to who want to add more functionality and improvements.

Note: Requires PHP 5.3 or greater.
